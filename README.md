This app allows you to connect your Legrand® Home + Control (Legrand®/Bticino) environment to Homey and control your devices directly from Homey.

More family of products will be added in the future, with time we hope to cover all of Home + Control products.

You should be advised that Legrand only grants 500 requests per day to third party developers, above that limit requests with API will be blocked, making the application unusable. You also need a developer account (Works with Legrand®) to use the app. 
Check my forum thread for more details.

Suggestions or problems?

If you have a device that's not supported or a suggestion or problem with this app please go to the forum or the github page linked on this page and let me know.

Also, if you're pleased with my app don't hesitate to buy me a coffee :)
