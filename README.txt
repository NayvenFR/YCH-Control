This app allows you to connect your Legrand® Home + Control (Legrand®/Bticino) environment to Homey and control your devices directly from Homey.

The supported devices are the following:

- Modular contactor for connected installation DRIVIA™ with Netatmo multifunction silent 20AX 230V
- Modular remote control switch for connected installation DRIVIA™ with Netatmo silent 1P 16AX 230V
- Micromodule for connected lighting for installation with Netatmo 300W with Neutral
- Dooxie™/Céliane™ connected power outlet with Netatmo 16A 3680W connection by automatic terminals
- Céliane™ connected mobile socket with Netatmo 16A 1 circuit 3680W ON-OFF and power measurement

The products mentioned were tested and are fully operational.

There is also the possibility that non-mentioned products may be functional, but we don't guarantee their working stability.

More family of products will be added in the future, with time we hope to cover all of Home + Control products.

You should be advised that Legrand only grants 500 requests per day to third party developers, above that limit requests with API will be blocked, making the application unusable. And that you may need a developer account (Works with Legrand®) to use the app, but it is yet to be confirmed.
